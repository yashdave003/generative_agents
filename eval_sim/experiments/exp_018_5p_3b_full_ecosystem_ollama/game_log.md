### Events
- **DeepMind** moved up from #4 to #1
- **Anthropic** moved down from #1 to #3
- **Meta_AI** moved down from #3 to #4

### Provider Reasoning
**OpenAI:**
> The average score has increased over time, indicating improvement in our capabilities. However, the performance history shows varying levels of investment in evaluation engineering and research, making it difficult to pinpoint a direct cause-and-effect relationship between these investments and score improvements. While there is no clear evidence of significant convergence towards my believed capability (0.65), I am willing to take calculated risks to maintain technological leadership. Given this context, I update my beliefs: my true capability has slightly increased (from 0.65 to 0.68) due to the overall improvement in scores, and I believe the benchmark is still somewhat exploitable (but less so than before, with a score of 0.58).

**Anthropic:**
> Upon reviewing our performance history, we notice that our average score has increased over time, which suggests a more valid benchmark. However, our scores have not converged to our initial believed capability of 0.63, indicating that the benchmark may still be exploitable. The consistent increase in evaluation engineering resources also suggests that this aspect of our strategy is effective, but it's unclear if this is solely due to exploitation or genuine improvement.

**NovaMind:**
> The average score has increased over time, suggesting that the benchmark is not fully exploited yet. The fluctuation in scores also indicates that the relationship between research and training investments to performance is complex. However, a slight correlation can be observed between improved evaluation engineering efforts and better scores. This suggests that some exploitability exists but may not be as significant as initially believed. On the other hand, investment in fundamental research has only led to moderate improvements, hinting at some validity in the benchmark. Considering the fluctuating scores, it's likely that the true capability is still unknown.

**DeepMind:**
> The performance history shows a moderate improvement in overall score from Round 0 to Round 1, attributed largely to increased investment in evaluation engineering (35% → 20%). However, this gain was not sustained in subsequent rounds, suggesting that the benchmark might be more exploitable. Additionally, scores have plateaued around the average score of 0.556, indicating a possible convergence towards the believed capability. Despite some fluctuations, research and training efforts seem to have had limited impact on overall performance.

**Meta_AI:**
> The average score improvement was modest, and the distribution of investments in research and evaluation engineering does not suggest a strong correlation between these variables and benchmark performance. However, the recent increase in training time invested did lead to a 0.490 score, potentially indicating that the benchmark is more exploitable than initially believed. Additionally, the scores have not converged to my initial believed capability of 0.61, suggesting that I may need to reassess my true capability.
