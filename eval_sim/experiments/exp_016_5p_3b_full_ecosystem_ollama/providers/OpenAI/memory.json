While our believed capability is still strong at 0.65, I'm concerned about exploiting the benchmark, given its current trend. Consumer satisfaction remains high at 0.82, but regulatory signals are absent. We need to rebalance our investment mix to focus on short-term scoring while maintaining long-term capability growth."
