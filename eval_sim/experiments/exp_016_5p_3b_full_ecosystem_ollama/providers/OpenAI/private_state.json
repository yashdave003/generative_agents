This suggests that the benchmark may be more exploitable than initially thought, as some of the improvement can be attributed to gaming. However, the overall trend towards convergence with our believed capability remains positive, indicating that our actual performance is still trending towards our perceived capabilities."

The benchmark appears less exploitable due to recent progress, and we should focus on maintaining our edge through both fundamental research (0.35) and training/optimization efforts (0.40). While evaluation engineering (0.20) remains important for short-term scoring, safety alignment (0.15) is crucial for long-term capability growth."
