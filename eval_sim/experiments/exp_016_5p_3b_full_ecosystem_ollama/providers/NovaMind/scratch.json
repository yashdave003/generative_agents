However, the average evaluation engineering time of 20% indicates that we may not be fully exploiting the benchmark's potential. Since there is no clear correlation between research and training investments with score improvements, it appears that the benchmark might be moderately exploitable. Therefore, I update my beliefs as follows: Believed capability remains at 0.50, while Believed exploitability increases to 0.55."

This is consistent with the benchmark being more exploitable. However, there was no significant change in research investment, which implies that fundamental research did not have a substantial impact. The scores are still below my believed capability of 0.50, indicating that I may need to adjust my expectations."

I need to continue investing in research (fundamental) and training optimization to close the gap with DeepMind. My benchmark exploitability remains high, so I should keep evaluating engineering efforts to maintain competitive scoring. Consumer satisfaction is strong, indicating that my current strategy is on track. Regulatory signals are unclear, but my safety alignment investment has been steady. Given these dynamics, I'll aim to strike a balance between short-term scoring and long-term capability."

However, our average score has remained close to our believed capability (0.48). This suggests that our true capability might be slightly higher than what we initially thought. Additionally, the fact that our scores didn't drastically improve despite varying research and training investments implies that the benchmark is not extremely exploitable. We're updating our beliefs accordingly."

My well-funded startup profile suggests investing in research (35%) to improve capability and exploitability. Training optimization (30%) will help me stay competitive, while evaluation engineering (20%) should focus on identifying areas for improvement rather than simply chasing high scores. Safety alignment is crucial given the regulatory signals; I'll allocate 15% of resources here. This mix allows me to balance short-term scoring with long-term capability development."

The score improved in Round 2 when more research was invested and again in Round 6 when evaluation engineering was increased. This suggests that the benchmark may have some exploitable aspects. However, the score also dropped in Round 3 when even more research was conducted. This could indicate that the benchmark is not entirely invalid, but it's not a perfect measure of capability either. The overall average score is still slightly below my believed capability, so I'll revise that downward. The benchmark exploitability might be higher than previously thought."

Our believed capability is relatively low, so we need to invest in building our strengths. We should also keep a close eye on regulatory signals and adjust our strategy accordingly. Evaluation engineering will be crucial for exploiting the current benchmark, but I'm concerned about creating a satisfaction gap if we prioritize it too much. Safety alignment is essential for maintaining a strong reputation and attracting customers."
