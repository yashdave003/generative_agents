OpenAI's consistent high scores and DeepMind's recent surge are concerns. To regain momentum, I'll prioritize fundamental research to bolster capability (0.55) and training optimization for immediate scoring gains (0.25). Evaluation engineering will receive some attention to ensure progress is measured fairly. Safety alignment remains crucial, but with a relatively low allocation due to resource constraints."
