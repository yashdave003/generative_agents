However, OpenAI's consistent high scores and Anthropic's stable performance suggest they're more adept at productizing their results. NovaMind and Meta_AI are still behind, but they might be due for a surge. Consumer satisfaction is high, which suggests that the market is patient with our scientific rigor. With pressure from Google to ship Gemini competitively, I need to balance short-term scoring with long-term capability.
