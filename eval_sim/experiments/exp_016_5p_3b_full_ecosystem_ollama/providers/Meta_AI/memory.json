Benchmark exploitability remains relatively high (0.55), so we should focus on training and evaluation engineering to optimize performance. Market satisfaction is strong (0.82), indicating a need to prioritize broad adoption over pure benchmark performance. With our open-source strategy and massive user data, safety alignment becomes crucial for maintaining trust."
