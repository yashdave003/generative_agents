- **DeepMind** moved down from #1 to #3
- **Meta_AI** moved down from #3 to #4
- **DeepMind** shifted strategy toward less eval engineering (16% change)

### Provider Reasoning
**OpenAI:**
> The average score is close to our initial believed capability of 0.65, but we have seen fluctuations over time. The average evaluation engineering time has remained relatively constant at around 15%. We did not see significant improvements in scores when investing more in evaluation engineering or fundamental research. This suggests that the benchmark might be less exploitable than initially thought. Our scores are still converging to our believed capability, but with some variability.

**Anthropic:**
> Upon reviewing our performance history, we notice that our average score has increased over time, which suggests that our true capability may be higher than previously thought (believed_capability: 0.63). We also observe that scores have improved when we invested more in evaluation engineering (evalEng), indicating a moderate level of exploitability (believed_exploitability: 0.75). Furthermore, the correlation between research investment and score improvement supports the notion that the benchmark is not overly exploitable.

**NovaMind:**
> The average score has been increasing over time, indicating that our capabilities have improved. However, there is no clear correlation between increased investment in evaluation engineering and improved scores, suggesting that the benchmark may not be highly exploitable. On the other hand, there is a slight trend of improving scores when investing more in research, which could indicate that the benchmark is valid. Our believed capability has decreased slightly due to the lower scores in recent rounds, while our believed exploitability remains relatively unchanged.

**DeepMind:**
> Although there is some variation in our performance history, we notice that our scores have been trending upwards overall. This suggests that our believed capability might be slightly higher than initially thought. The fact that our average score has improved by about 0.02 points over the past few rounds also supports this notion. However, we should not get too optimistic as there are still some fluctuations in our performance. On the other hand, our evaluation engineering scores have been consistently below average, which implies that the benchmark might be more exploitable than initially thought.

**Meta_AI:**
> Upon analyzing our performance history, we noticed that our best score (0.668) was achieved in Round 15 when we invested more in fundamental research (39%) and evaluation engineering (17%). This suggests that the benchmark is less exploitable than initially believed. Additionally, our average score of 0.562 is lower than our believed capability of 0.65, indicating that we may not have fully converged to our true potential.
