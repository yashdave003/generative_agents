  "description": "Full ecosystem v6: 5 providers, 2 benchmarks (coding + reasoning), 12 consumer segments (4 use-cases \u00d7 3 archetypes), 1 policymaker, 3 funders (2 VC + 1 Gov) with high capital ($2B/$500M/$100M). NEW v6 features: funder diversification (observe other funders' allocations), per-benchmark score reporting (console output), optional benchmark sequence. Funder rework: 10% per-round deployment cap, 2-round cooldown, momentum-based scoring with diversification signal. LLM mode via Ollama.",
