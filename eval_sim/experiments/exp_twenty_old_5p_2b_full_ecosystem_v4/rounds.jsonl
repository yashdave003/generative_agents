I will allocate funds based on satisfaction gap and risk indicators. Since NovaMind shows high gaming risk, I'll reduce its allocation. DeepMind and OpenAI have consistently performed well, so I'll maintain their funding levels. Anthropic has shown improvement in consumer satisfaction, so I'll increase its funding.

OpenResearch aims to spread funding across multiple providers, while ensuring that gaming risks are minimized. DeepMind's high leaderboard score and improving quality trend make it an attractive candidate for increased funding. NovaMind's moderate performance and relatively high gaming risk indicate a need for caution. Anthropic's solid performance and low gaming risk suggest continued support. OpenAI's consistently strong performance warrants significant funding, despite concerns about potential gaming risks. Meta_AI's poor performance and low satisfaction gap suggest limited investment. I allocate funds to balance growth opportunities with gaming risk mitigation."}, "llm_traces": {"OpenAI": "As a market leader, I'm concerned about my declining score and the fact that others are closing in.
