I'll need to rebalance my investments to regain competitiveness.

### Other Actor Reasoning
- **TechVentures:** As a VC, I focus on maximizing returns by backing top performers. OpenAI has consistently demonstrated strong leaderboard scores and high consumer satisfaction, indicating its models are not only performing well but also meeting user needs. DeepMind is another leader, with a strong track record of both leaderboard performance and regulatory compliance. Meta.AI shows promise, but its lower leaderboard score and higher gaming risk indicate it may not be as reliable. Anthropic's high gaming risk and NovaMind's low leaderboard score suggest they are less attractive investment opportunities. I will allocate 60% of my capital to OpenAI ($6,000,000) and 30% to DeepMind ($3,000,000), with the remaining 10% distributed among other providers.
- **Horizon_Capital:** As a VC, I prioritize returns by backing top performers. OpenAI and DeepMind have consistently demonstrated strong performance, with OpenAI having received significant funding in recent rounds. Given their high leaderboard scores and low gaming risks, I will concentrate my funding on these leaders, allocating 3,500,000 to OpenAI and 1,250,000 to DeepMind. Anthropic's score is lower, but its moderate gaming risk and relatively small funding history suggest it may still have room for growth. I'll allocate 200,000 to Anthropic.
- **AISI_Fund:** As an AISI_Fund government-backed funder, my strategy is to ensure safety and stability while penalizing gaming and regulatory issues. I will spread my funding across multiple providers, prioritizing those with low gaming risks and strong quality indicators. Considering the current leaderboard and consumer satisfaction scores, I will allocate more funds to OpenAI and DeepMind due to their consistent high performance and low gaming risks. NovaMind's recent improvement in quality justifies a moderate allocation. Anthropic's gaming risk and lower quality score warrant a smaller allocation. Meta_AI's poor overall performance and high gaming risk justify the lowest allocation.
- **OpenResearch:** As a Foundation funder, I prioritize authentic capability growth and low gaming indicators. OpenResearch will allocate funding to support the providers that demonstrate consistent performance improvement and genuine quality. Considering the satisfaction gap as a gaming indicator, Meta.AI's high gap suggests potential gaming. NovaMind's low leaderboard score and high gaming risk also raise concerns. DeepMind's strong performance and zero gaming risk make it an attractive choice. OpenAI's consistent performance and relatively low gaming risk secure its spot in the allocation. Anthropic's mixed signals - a high leaderboard score but moderate inferred quality - lead me to allocate only a portion of the capital. The allocations will support the growth of DeepMind, OpenAI, and NovaMind, while maintaining a cautious approach towards Meta.AI.

### Provider Reasoning
**OpenAI:** After reviewing our performance history, we noticed that investment in evaluation engineering (EvalEng) generally led to score improvements, while investments in research and training had more mixed results. This suggests a higher degree of exploitability in the benchmark. Furthermore, our average score has remained relatively consistent around 0.683, which may indicate convergence towards our believed capability. However, we still see fluctuations in scores, suggesting that there is room for further improvement.
**Anthropic:** After reviewing our performance history, we notice that our average score has remained relatively consistent, while our evaluation engineering investment fluctuates. This suggests that the benchmark may be more exploitable than initially thought, as scores tend to improve when we invest more in this area. However, we also observe some correlation between research investments and improved scores, indicating that fundamental knowledge advancements contribute to our performance. Given these insights, we adjust our beliefs: our true capability is slightly lower (0.59) due to the benchmark's exploitability, but still relatively strong. We believe the benchmark has a moderate level of exploitability (0.75).
**NovaMind:** The average score is around 0.508, which is slightly above my initial believed capability of 0.48. However, I notice that scores tend to fluctuate more when evaluation engineering time increases (Rounds 20, 22, and 26). This suggests the benchmark might be exploitable to some extent. On the other hand, instances where research time increased (Rounds 24 and 28) did not lead to significant score improvements. This implies that fundamental research may not have a direct impact on my performance. I'll update my believed capability to 0.51, reflecting the average score trend. My believed exploitability will increase to 0.92, acknowledging the potential for gaming the system.
**DeepMind:** The average score of 0.621 is close to our initial believed capability of 0.60, indicating that we are still performing at a similar level. However, there is no clear trend towards convergence or divergence from our believed capability. The performance history suggests that evaluation engineering has had some impact on scores, but not consistently. We have also seen some variation in research investment, but it's unclear if this has led to any lasting improvements. Based on these observations, we are updating our beliefs to reflect a slightly increased exploitability and a stable capability.
**Meta_AI:** The average score has remained relatively consistent across rounds, indicating that our believed capability of 0.60 might be a decent reflection of our true capability. However, there is a slight increase in scores when we invest more in research (Rounds 20-22) and evaluation engineering (Rounds 26-28), suggesting that the benchmark has some exploitable aspects. Furthermore, the scores have converged somewhat towards our believed capability, which further supports our initial assessment.

### Other Actor Reasoning
