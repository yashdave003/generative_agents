However, scores have been improving over time, especially in Round 1 where research investment increased by 6% and training investment decreased by 3%. This could indicate that the benchmark has some exploitable aspects, as a 6% increase in research investment led to a 0.052 improvement in score. Our believed capability is still relatively high at 0.68, but we should be cautious about overestimating our true capabilities. The exploitability of the benchmark seems to be around 0.65."

While I still maintain a strong fundamental research foundation (42%), I recognize the need to shift more focus towards training optimization (35%) to close the gap with competitors. Although evaluation engineering (14%) has historically been less effective for me, it's essential to maintain some investment here to avoid creating a satisfaction gap. With regulators signaling no immediate concerns, I'll prioritize research and training over safety alignment this round."

Research effort has varied widely across rounds, but seems to be positively correlated with some improvements. The fact that the score hasn't converged to my initial believed capability (0.61) suggests that there may still be room for improvement.
