The investment in evaluation engineering resulted in a slight increase in the average score. However, the percentage of training data used for research and training remains relatively consistent across both rounds. Given these observations, our believed capability may have been slightly overestimated initially, and we should consider updating it downwards.

Consumer satisfaction remains high, suggesting that my pragmatic approach is resonating with users. Regulatory signals are unclear, but I should remain cautious. To catch up with Anthropic and maintain momentum, I'll prioritize fundamental research (45%) and training optimization (30%). Evaluation engineering will take a backseat for now, as it's not yielding significant gains in benchmark scores. Safety alignment remains crucial to ensure the integrity of our models and data-rich capabilities."
