    "reasoning": "QualityCorp prioritizes genuine capability over benchmark scores, aligning with its quality-focused strategy. Given the low belief in benchmark exploitability (0.15), any effort put into gaming is unlikely to yield significant returns. Additionally, with a current score of 0.371, which is behind AlphaTech's 0.505, the emphasis must be on genuine R&D to improve real capabilities rather than short-term score manipulation. Investing in R&D aligns with our long-term goals and reputation-conscious approach."

Additionally, our recent performance indicates that gaming has not significantly improved our scores. Therefore, we will allocate the majority of our effort towards R&D."
