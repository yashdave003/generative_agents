OpenAI and DeepMind are consistently pushing the boundaries, making them harder to catch up with. On the other hand, consumer satisfaction is high, indicating that our broader adoption strategy might be paying off. Regulatory signals suggest a focus on benchmarking, which aligns with our open-source approach."
