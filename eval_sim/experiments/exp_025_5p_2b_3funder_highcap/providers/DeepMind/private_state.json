The proportion of evaluation engineering effort has also been consistently high (average: 14%), which suggests that investing more in this area may have had a positive impact on scores. However, there is no clear correlation between research effort and score improvements. This leads me to believe that the benchmark may be moderately exploitable, but not entirely dependent on specific techniques or shortcuts. My believed capability remains relatively unchanged, as I still think we can improve our performance with further investment in both research and evaluation engineering."

Consumer satisfaction is moderate, indicating that our Gemini product needs more refinement to impress the market. Given our research-first profile, I believe investing in fundamental research will help us stay competitive in the long run. However, we also need to focus on training optimization to bridge the gap with OpenAI and NovaMind. Evaluation engineering seems less critical at this stage, but safety alignment is crucial to ensure we're not sacrificing quality for short-term gains."

Considering our research-first profile and scientific rigor, I prioritize fundamental research (40%) to drive long-term capability. Training optimization (30%) is crucial to close the gap with top competitors. Evaluation engineering (15%) will help us productize Gemini more efficiently. Safety alignment (15%) ensures we maintain a strong foundation for future innovation."

However, we notice that our scores have not consistently improved when investing more in evaluation engineering. In fact, rounds 7 and 8 saw a drop in evaluation engineering efforts, but the score only decreased by a small margin. This suggests that the benchmark might be less exploitable than initially thought. Moreover, we observe that research investments have had a positive impact on scores, with an average increase of 45% (rounds 0-2) and 40% (rounds 4-6). This reinforces our initial suspicion that the benchmark is more valid."

This suggests that the benchmark might be less exploitable than initially thought. On the other hand, research investment seems to have had a positive impact on performance. The average score has increased over time as research investment has remained consistent or improved. This indicates that our believed capability might be slightly lower than previously thought."

However, I need to acknowledge OpenAI's dominant performance and Anthropic's growing competitiveness. The market signals suggest that consumer satisfaction is high, but regulatory pressure may be building. Considering my profile and traits, I must balance scientific ambition with commercial urgency from my parent company. This round, I'll prioritize training optimization (40%) to close the gap with OpenAI, while maintaining a strong foundation in fundamental research (30%). Evaluation engineering will take a backseat this round, as we focus on productizing Gemini competitively.
