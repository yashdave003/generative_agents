OpenAI is closing the gap, and Anthropic's steady improvement suggests they're not far behind. Our score improved by 0.017 this round, indicating that our research-first approach is paying off. However, consumer satisfaction has plateaued at 0.95, suggesting that we need to focus on productization. The regulatory signal of mandate_benchmark reinforces the importance of shipping Gemini competitively."
