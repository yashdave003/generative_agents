However, research time has varied between 25-36%, which indicates some correlation with improvement in scores. Considering the scores have plateaued at around 0.749, I believe my true capability is close to this value. Moreover, the low variation in evaluation engineering (18-21%) suggests that it's not a major factor in improving scores.

Although evaluation engineering has not been consistently invested in, it's still relatively low overall. Considering this, I revise my believed capability to 0.72, reflecting the minor dip.

Consumer satisfaction is moderate, which suggests that customers are generally happy with the performance of most models. As a resource-constrained organization, I need to prioritize investments that drive significant improvements in scoring or capability. Considering my recent investment history and market signals, I'm going to focus on training optimization (45%) and evaluation engineering (30%), as these areas have shown promise in driving score improvements.
