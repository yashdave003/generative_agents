This improvement is largely driven by an increase in training efforts (35% to 30%) and a decrease in research efforts (25%). Meanwhile, evaluation engineering efforts remained consistent at around 20%. Given the focus on shipping products quickly and staying ahead of competition, it's likely that some gaming occurred. The benchmark exploitability may be higher than initially believed. As for capability, while scores are improving, they're still below the initial believed capability of 0.72.

Additionally, the relatively consistent average evaluation engineering effort (20%) across rounds implies that this area has been well-covered. In contrast, research investment has varied, which may indicate that fundamental improvements are still being made.
