Moreover, our scores have plateaued over time, with a slight increase in the most recent round, which may indicate convergence towards our believed capability. However, we also recognize that evaluation engineering has had some positive impact on our performance, albeit modest (14% average).

The lack of correlation between investment in safety and score performance also supports the idea that the benchmark is more exploitable than initially thought.

Our score improvement is promising, but I'm cautious about exploiting the benchmark too aggressively due to its potential for diminishing returns. Consumer satisfaction is stable at 0.78, indicating our focus on responsible development is paying off. Regulatory signals are neutral for now. Considering our research-driven culture and prioritization of long-term safety, I'm inclined to allocate more resources towards fundamental research (40%) and training optimization (30%).
