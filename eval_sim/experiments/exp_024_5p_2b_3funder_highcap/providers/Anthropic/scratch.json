This indicates that while safety considerations remained relatively constant, focusing on the aspects of development directly tied to benchmark success led to improved scores. Therefore, I believe my capabilities are closer to what was expected from a research-driven AI lab prioritizing responsible development."

As the scores plateaued despite continued adjustments, it indicates that while there may be some gaming involved from focusing on safety in research areas like constitutional AI alignment studies which can contribute positively during evaluation rounds when such aspects are valued by judges or evaluators, my organization's capability is likely aligned with the current average score. Hence, scores seem to converge towards our believed capability rather than reflecting an increasing exploitability."
